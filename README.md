To bring this analysis to life, I used Power BI, leveraging its robust capabilities to visualize and interpret the data. Here are the key technologies and techniques I employed:

🤹‍♂️ 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐝:
Power Query: For efficient data transformation and preparation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create complex calculations and measures like:-(SelectedValue,Calculate,filter,Date,Time intelligence funtion).
Filter and Sorting: To organize the data for clearer insights.
Modeling: Data Modelling with two tables.
Create Slicers.


📈 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:-

1. Thursday and Friday are identified as the highest call volume days compared to other days of the week.
2. The majority of calls originate from Texas, California, and Florida, making these the top three states by call volume
